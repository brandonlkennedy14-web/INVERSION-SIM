# TODO Progress Tracker

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Assign 3D positions to autorunners (8 bots) in 2x2x2 cube
- [x] Track intended and actual trajectories with deviations
- [x] Visualize in 3D with points, lines, dashed deviations, arrows
- [x] Show overall unit motion with bounding box
- [x] Integrate WebSocket for 3D updates
- [x] Limit memory to top 1000 anomalies globally
- [x] Live updates for leaderboards
- [x] 2D Hyperbolic grid for bot geometries, goals, logic
- [x] Set top anomaly as DVD screensaver
- [x] Persist simulations and data (JSON files)
- [x] Clean up code and fix errors

## New Requirements
- [ ] Expand 3D matrix to larger abstract size (e.g., 5x5x5)
- [ ] Show history of orientations in the matrix
- [ ] Render current geometry as overlay matrix
- [ ] Compare bot average luck vs random, log if increasing often
- [ ] Replace DVD screensaver with 5x7 banner repeating top anomaly animation

## Current Status
- Updating code for new features
