# TODO - PDF-Inspired Bot Fleet Optimizations

Based on TOP SECRET PDF insights:
- Compression, Coprimality, and Second-order Regulation in Biological Systems
- Constraint-Only Learning
- Representation Constraints, Harmonics, and the Ruliad
- Geometric Constraint Circuits for Symbolic Prime Growth
- Primes as Singularities: A Geometric, Spectral, and Information Theoretic Framework

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Add Coprime Coordination Layer
- [x] Track bot "resonance" (connectivity) and "irreducibility" (independence) metrics
- [x] Ensure bots don't synchronize too much - maintain phase diversity
- [x] Add "harmonic coupling" - weak shared signals between bots
- [x] Implement entropy measures for coordination

### Phase 2: Enhance Second-Order Regulation
- [x] Bots adapt not just configs but LEARNING STRATEGIES themselves
- [x] Add meta-feedback: bots learn WHAT to learn
- [x] Implement "constraint evolution" - constraints themselves evolve based on patterns

### Phase 3: Add Geometric Topology Mapping
- [x] Implement horizontal axis = resonance (how connected to other bots)
- [x] Implement vertical axis = irreducibility (how unique/distinct the bot's behavior is)
- [x] Bots move on this topology based on their actions
- [x] Add 3D temporal lifting for emergence tracking

### Phase 4: Enhance Stuckness Phase
- [x] Add more sophisticated stuckness detection: cycling, local minima
- [x] Add more redirect strategies: back up, strip complexity, invert, perturb, expose assumptions
- [x] Implement phase diversity tracking

### Phase 5: Add Spectral Analysis
- [x] Analyze bot behavior patterns in frequency domain
- [x] Detect periodicities and harmonics
- [x] Use for anomaly detection improvement

## Key Concepts Applied

From "Compression, Coprimality, and Second-order Regulation in Biological Systems":
- Health = appropriate compression, preserved coprime domains
- Disease = over-compression, loss of coprimality, forced uniform behavior
- Flock-like organization: agents follow local rules under shared constraints
- Harmonic coordination: oscillations remain locally governed but weakly coupled

From "Constraint-Only Learning":
- Never transmit answers, transmit constraints
- Stuckness as sacred phase
- Redirect sideways: back up, strip complexity, invert, perturb, expose assumptions

From "Primes as Singularities":
- Integer topology: horizontal = resonance, vertical = irreducibility
- 3D lifting with time for emergence
- Entropy: high = composite (more connected), low = prime (more independent)
