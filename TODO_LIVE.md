### Phase 3: Problem Solving
- [ ] Analyze PDFs for insights on autorunner learning visualization
- [ ] Design implementation for seeing how autorunners try to learn

## Notes from PDF Reading:

### Key Insights from PDFs:

1. **MaxG Compression Fields (appliedmath-4161690.pdf)**: 
   - CF0 = Enumeration Field (explicit microscopic degrees of freedom)
   - CF1 = Structural Compression Field (compresses by factoring repetition/relation)
   - CF2 = Optimal Compression Field (compresses to governing principles)
   - RELEVANCE: Autorunners compress learning into behavioral patterns via CF1→CF2

2. **Braided Sixth-chord Geometry**: 
   - Sixth chords = cooperative states preserving plurality
   - Braiding = parallel interests that don't merge
   - RELEVANCE: Autorunners can have braided trajectories showing intended vs actual paths

3. **constraint-only-learning.pdf**:
   - Key insight: NEVER transmit answers, only transmit CONSTRAINTS
   - Learning emerges from constraint satisfaction
   - RELEVANCE: Autorunners should learn by receiving constraints, not solutions

4. **CornerReflector_Final_Merged_Paper.pdf**:
   - Local rules produce emergent band structure
   - Simple local interactions create complex global patterns
   - RELEVANCE: Bot fleet can show local rule → global anomaly emergence

5. **Geometric_Constraint_Circuits.pdf**:
   - Arithmetic compiled into geometric structure
   - Symbolic inference from geometric constraints
   - RELEVANCE: Bot goals (anomaly detection) compiled into geometric trajectories

### Common Theme Across PDFs:
The PDFs collectively suggest that autorunner learning should:
- Use COMPRESSION (like CF0→CF1→CF2) to abstract behaviors
- Show BRAIDED TRAJECTORIES (intended vs actual) to visualize learning
- Transmit CONSTRAINTS not answers for learning
- Display LOCAL→GLOBAL emergence (like band structure from local rules)

This directly informs how to implement "seeing how autorunners try to learn":
- Show intended trajectory (what bot planned) vs actual trajectory (what happened)
- Display constraint satisfaction process (how bot learned)
- Visualize compression of experience into behavioral patterns

## Action Items After PDF Analysis:

For Phase 3 (Problem Solving), the implementation should:
1. In autorunnerMap: Show TWO trajectories per bot - intended (green) and actual (red/dashed)
2. Add constraint visualization - show what constraints each bot is satisfying
3. Display learning progress - show how bot's trajectory changes over time as it learns
4. Visualize the "braiding" of multiple bots' trajectories as they coordinate
